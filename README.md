These are the models: 
Waterfall Model: Sequential process divided into distinct phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. 
Progression is linear; each phase must be completed before moving to the next. 
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and stable environments. 

Agile Model: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and customer feedback. 
Development is done in small, incremental cycles called sprints. 
Emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and quick responses to changes. 
Well-suited for projects with evolving requirements or where rapid deployment is essential. 

Spiral Model: Combines elements of both waterfall and iterative development models. 
Progresses through cycles (spirals), each involving risk analysis, planning, development, and testing. 
Iteratively builds on previous iterations, incorporating feedback and adjustments. 
Ideal for large, complex projects with high risk factors. 

V-Model: Extension of the waterfall model, emphasizing testing throughout the development life cycle. 
Each phase of development has a corresponding phase of testing. 


Task dependencies, consisting of four distinct types, are the relationships between tasks that 
dictate their completion sequence.

Finish to Start- Task dependency is a common issue where Task B is delayed until Task A is 
completed, like painting walls before building them.
Start to Start- Task B cannot begin until Task A begins
Start to Finish- Task B cannot be completed until Task A starts.
Finish to Finish- Task B cannot be completed until Task A is complete

 Traceability helps with risk management, dependency identification, and regulatory standard 
compliance verification. In general, traceability increases the quality of the outputs overall, decreases 
mistakes, and improves communication

2 Stakeholder Analysis: the methodical process of evaluating and comprehending 
stakeholders' relationships, impact, expectations, and interests. It aids in determining the 
responsibilities, importance, and possible effects of stakeholders on a project or endeavour.

1.3 Primary Stakeholders: People, teams, or organizations that are immediately influenced by a 
project's or organization's activities or results. They are usually directly involved in the project's 
operations and have a considerable stake in its success or failure

1.4 Secondary Stakeholders: Individuals, groups, or organizations that are indirectly affected by 
the actions or outcomes of a project or organization. While they may not have as direct an 
interest as primary stakeholders, their support, opposition, or involvement can still significantly 
influence the project's success or failure.




Current situation

The Business Analyst Is to understand how the company operates or functions. 
The Business have the responsibility to communicate the time and 
expectations to complete requirements gathering. The Business Analyst must 
be able to strategize and plan, also the communication is important to the 
Shareholder
• Stakeholders seek information about their requirements and seek guidance 
from business analysts, project managers, and sponsors. 
• Effective communication is crucial throughout the project. 
• Stakeholders value quantifiable metrics, such as time, cost, performance, or 
percentage of project completion, as they provide a relative measurement of 
performance.
• Subjective reports are not desirable, demonstrating stakeholder involvement 
and a need for more communication


Certainly! Here's a more concise summary:

1. Identify stakeholders.
2. Understand their communication preferences and needs.
3. Set communication objectives.
4. Choose suitable communication channels.
5. Develop a communication plan detailing who, what, when, and how.
6. Establish a schedule for regular updates.
7. Manage expectations by clarifying roles and responsibilities.
8. Provide timely and relevant updates to stakeholders.
9. Encourage open dialogue and feedback.
10. Address conflicts constructively.
11. Document all communication for future reference and accountability.
